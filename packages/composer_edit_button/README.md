Overview
==========
This is a concrete5 toolbar button that allows a logged in administrator to quickly edit the current viewed page via the composer. 

Installation
==========
Place the folder *composer_edit_button* (rename if necessary) in the top level *packages* folder of your concrete5 site and install via the Dashboard install function. No other install steps are required. 

The button will automatically display on the top edit bar while logged in, for pages that are editable via the composer. 

## Requires 
Requires at least concrete5 version 5.4.1.1, but you should really be running 5.6.x as it's awesome.
